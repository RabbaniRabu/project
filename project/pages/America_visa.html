<h4>US Student Visa</h4>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>US Student Visa Application:</h3>
     <p>Many Indian students make plans to go to American universities for college-level education, as some of the colleges in the US rank among the top universities in the world and also because US boasts of more education institutes than any other country around. 
        However, applying for colleges in the US involves more than getting the approval academically as a student. It also involves applying for the US student visa correctly. It is the American Embassy that issues student visas to the United States. 
        As obtaining a USA Visa can be a lengthy process, it is advisable to submit the application well ahead of the date by which you need entry for your education course in the USA. Choosing the right type of Visa according to the purpose of your visit is one of the most important steps to avoid Visa Rejection.</p>
        
            <h3>Types of US visas:</h3>
            <p>The US Government offers three different Student Visa types:</p>
            <p>F-1 (Student Visa) - The F-1 visa which is for full-time students who are enrolled in an academic or language program. F-1 students can stay in the US for the whole duration of their academic program plus 2 months. It is a prerequisite for F-1 students to maintain a full-time course load and complete their studies by the expiration date listed on the I-20 form.</p>
            <p>J-1 (Exchange Visitor Visa) - The J-1 visa is for students who need practical training in order to complete their academic program. The training must be directly related to the academic program. The J-1 visa obligates the student to return to their home countries for a minimum of 2 years after the end of their studies in the US</p>
            <p>As a primary step, you must first apply and be accepted by a US school or university that is certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Once accepted, you will receive a Form I-20 from the institution's international student office, which is a paper record of your information in the database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).</p>
          

            <h3>Visa Validity:</h3>
            <p>After you receive your visa, book your travel to the US:</p>
            <p>F-1 visa holders may enter the US 30 days prior to the start date on their I-20 and which is valid for 60 days following the date of completion of your program listed on the I-20.</p>
            <p>J-1 visa holders may also enter the US 30 days prior to the start date on their DS-160, but may stay on only 30 days beyond the date of completion listed on the DS-160.</p>
            <p>The visa will expire within the duration of status change; one has to apply for a new visa at their US embassy or consulate.</p>

            <h3>US Visa Interview:</h3>
            <p>After completing the form filling process, you will have to take a printed confirmation to your interview. You may wish to prepare for your visa interview. Student visa applicants should be able to demonstrate three criteria to visa officers: - You are completing a genuine degree or study abroad program in the US</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must have the funds for the first year of your stay in the US and a plan for the remaining years.</li>
                <li>That your activities are in line with the purpose (and in particular the non-immigrant intent) of the visa you will travel on</li> 
            </ul>

            <h3>Processing Time:</h3>
            <p>You will leave your passport with the U.S. Embassy after the appointment. Expect to receive your visa and passport back within an average of 5-7 working days. The process for obtaining a US student visa from one of the embassies in India might seem long and complicated. The more you are prepared and the faster you put together your documentation, the quicker you will be able to start your adventure at a US university.</p>
            

            <h3>Below are the documents you have to submit for completion of formalities:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A passport that is valid for at least six months beyond your stay period in the United States</li>
                <li>The confirmation page of the Non-immigrant visa application form DS-160</li>
                <li>fee receipt (If application fee is to be paid prior to the interview)</li>
                <li>Photographs according to Specifications</li>
                <li>I-20 Form sent by the school for F-1 and M-1 visas (These forms need to be signed both by the school and the individual)</li>
                <li>Transcripts or diplomas or certificates from school/college attended by the applicant</li>
                <li>Standardized test scores required by the US school</li>
                <li>Proof to cover educational, living and other expenses</li>
            </ul>
